# Cryptocurrency Wallet Backend

Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Wallet Backend project! This robust and secure Spring Boot application serves as the core infrastructure for a modern cryptocurrency wallet. It handles essential functionalities such as user management, wallet creation, secure storage of private keys, and the processing of cryptographic transactions, all exposed via a well-defined RESTful API.

Built with security and scalability in mind, this backend leverages industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and follows best practices for authentication and authorization. It's designed to be stateless and compatible with distributed systems, providing a solid foundation for a performant and reliable wallet application.

## Features

This backend offers a rich set of features, designed to provide a secure and functional base for any cryptocurrency wallet:

### User Authentication & Authorization:

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to securely sign up with username, email, and password. Robust validation is applied to ensure data integrity and security (e.g., minimum password length, valid email format).
- **User Login**: Authenticates existing users and issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful login. This token is used for subsequent requests to protected resources.
- **JWT-based Security**: Implements stateless authentication using JWTs, providing a highly scalable and secure mechanism. Spring Security is configured to validate incoming JWTs and authorize access to API endpoints.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely stored using BCrypt hashing, protecting against brute-force attacks and database breaches.
- **Role-Based Access (Basic)**: Authenticated users are assigned a default ROLE_USER, enabling access to protected endpoints.

### Wallet Management:

- **Wallet Creation**: Enables authenticated users to create a new cryptocurrency wallet linked to their user account. Each wallet is assigned a unique public address (derived from its public key).
- **Secure Private Key Storage**: Private keys are generated using strong cryptographic techniques (ECDSA) and are then encrypted using AES-256 GCM before being stored in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, private keys remain protected.
- **Wallet Retrieval**: Allows users to fetch the details of their wallets, including their public address and current balances.
- **Multi-Currency Balance Support**: Wallets can maintain balances across different cryptocurrencies (e.g., USD, BTC).

### Transaction Processing:

- **Send Transaction**: Facilitates the initiation of cryptocurrency transfers between wallets.
- **Cryptographic Signature Verification**: Each transaction requires a digital signature generated by the sender's private key. The backend rigorously verifies this signature using the sender's public key (fromAddress) to ensure:
    - **Authentication**: The transaction genuinely originates from the stated sender.
    - **Integrity**: The transaction data has not been tampered with in transit.
    - **Replay Attack Protection**: Transactions are uniquely identified by their signature, preventing the same transaction from being processed multiple times.
- **Atomic Balance Updates**: Balances of both sender and receiver wallets are updated atomically within a transaction, ensuring data consistency even in concurrent scenarios.
- **Fund Validation**: Checks for sufficient funds in the sender's wallet before processing a transaction.

### Cryptographic Operations:

- **AES-256 GCM Encryption/Decryption**: Used for symmetric encryption of sensitive data like private keys, providing confidentiality and authenticated encryption.
- **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) with secp256k1**: Employed for generating and verifying digital signatures for transactions, ensuring non-repudiation and integrity. The Bouncy Castle cryptography provider is integrated for these advanced algorithms.

### RESTful API Design:

- Clean, intuitive, and standard-compliant RESTful API endpoints for all operations.
- Uses appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

### Robust Error Handling:

- Implements a global exception handler to gracefully catch and translate internal errors into meaningful, client-friendly API responses.
- Custom exceptions (e.g., InvalidTransactionException, UserAlreadyExistsException, UserNotFoundException) provide specific error contexts.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging using SLF4j and Logback helps monitor application behavior and diagnose issues.
- **API Documentation**: Integrated with SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI) for automatic API documentation generation, making it easy to explore and interact with the endpoints.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Cryptocurrency Wallet Backend up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Apache Maven 3.x
- Docker Desktop (includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose)
- Git
- Postman (or any API testing client)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheAlchemistNerd/Cryptocurrency-Wallet.git
cd Cryptocurrency-Wallet
```

### 2. Environment Variables Setup (Crucial!)

This project relies on environment variables for sensitive cryptographic keys. **Do NOT** hardcode these into your application code.

You have two critical secrets:

- `CRYPTO_AES_SECRET`: A 32-byte (256-bit) key, Base64-encoded, used for AES encryption/decryption of private keys.
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: A 32-byte (256-bit) key, Base64-encoded, used for signing JWTs (HMAC-SHA256).

**How to Generate Secure Keys:**

Use the provided `KeyGenerator` utility class to generate cryptographically strong, Base64-encoded keys:

```bash
# Compile the KeyGenerator utility
mvn compile

# Run the KeyGenerator
java -cp target/classes com.cryptowallet.tool.KeyGenerator
```

This will output two Base64-encoded strings. Copy these values carefully.

**Configuration for Development:**

For local development and testing, you can use an `.env` file (for Docker Compose) or set them directly in your IntelliJ IDEA Run Configuration.

#### a) Using `.env` for Docker Compose:

Create a file named `.env` (or `env.test` if your `docker-compose.yml` references it as `env_file: .env`) in the root directory of your project (where `docker-compose.yml` is located).

```
# .env file example (replace with your generated keys)
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=test
CRYPTO_AES_SECRET=YOUR_GENERATED_BASE64_AES_KEY_HERE
JWT_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_GENERATED_BASE64_JWT_KEY_HERE
JWT_EXPIRATION=3600000
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values and **no trailing spaces**.

#### b) Setting in IntelliJ IDEA Run Configuration:

Go to **Run > Edit Configurations...**

- Select your `CryptoWalletApplication`.
- In the *Environment variables* field, click the `...` button.
- Add:

```
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=test
CRYPTO_AES_SECRET=YOUR_GENERATED_BASE64_AES_KEY_HERE
JWT_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_GENERATED_BASE64_JWT_KEY_HERE
JWT_EXPIRATION=3600000
```

### 3. Run the Application

#### Option A: Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Local Development)

This will start both your MongoDB database and Spring Boot app in separate Docker containers.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can check status with:

```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To stop:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

#### Option B: Running Locally (Requires Local MongoDB Instance)

Ensure MongoDB is running on `localhost:27017`.

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

App starts on port `8080`.

## Security Considerations

Security is paramount in a cryptocurrency wallet. This project implements several key measures:

- **Strong Key Generation**: Utilizes `java.security.SecureRandom` and `openssl` (via the utility) for generating cryptographically secure random bytes for all secret keys.
- **AES-256 GCM Encryption**: Private keys are encrypted using AES in GCM mode, which provides both confidentiality and data authenticity/integrity.
- **ECDSA (secp256k1) Digital Signatures**: Transactions are digitally signed using ECDSA, ensuring that only the legitimate owner can authorize a transfer and that transaction data remains untampered.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Stateless authentication tokens are used, which are efficient and scalable for distributed systems. JWTs are signed to prevent tampering.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plaintext. BCrypt is used to hash passwords, making them resistant to rainbow table attacks and brute-force attempts.
- **Stateless Sessions**: By using JWTs and disallowing traditional sessions, the backend avoids session fixation attacks and improves scalability.
- **CSRF Protection Disabled (API-only)**: CSRF protection is explicitly disabled as this is a stateless REST API backend.
- **Secret Key Management**: Environment variables are used for sensitive keys (AES and JWT secrets) to prevent them from being committed directly into the codebase. The `KeyGenerator` utility aids in safely generating these.
- **Replay Attack Prevention**: The unique index on transaction signatures (`@Indexed(unique = true)`) in `TransactionDocument` prevents the same signed transaction from being submitted and processed multiple times.
- **HTTPS (Production Requirement)**: All production deployments **MUST** be served over HTTPS to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure the confidentiality of JWTs and other sensitive data in transit.
